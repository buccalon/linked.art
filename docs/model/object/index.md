## Introduction

The core of any art historical information system is the art objects themselves. The class for physical objects that have some value in human society is `HumanMadeObject`. Even if the object is a shell (and thus natural) without any significant modifications, this class is still used as the modification is the instilling of value by society. This also keeps the model easy to use, rather than having to worry about the degree of change that would be significant for the distinction.


## Shared Patterns

The [basic patterns](/model/base/) apply to objects, as does the [digital integration layer](/model/digital/). These patterns are used throughout the documentation.

## Sections

The following sections are uniquely about physical objects:

* [Production and Destruction](production/) -- How the work is produced and/or destroyed
* [Physical Characteristics](physical/) -- Dimensions, Shapes, Colors, Materials and Parts
* [Aboutness](aboutness/) -- Descriptions of the artwork
* [Ownership](ownership/) -- The current owner and location of the artwork
* [Rights Information](rights/) -- Rights information, other than ownership
* [Digital](/model/digital/) -- For digital representations of objects, see the top level section
* ["Immovable" Objects](/model/place/) -- Objects that are too large to conveniently move are covered in the section on Places
