## Software

This is a page with references to software that lets you implement all of this.

## Libraries

* [Crom](http://github.com/linked-art/crom)
> A python library to try and make it easier to treat resources as instances of classes with properties, rather than a graph.
* [LinkedArt.js](https://linkedartjs.org/)
> Javascript library to deal with linked art JSON
* [Linked.Art.Net](https://github.com/tomcrane/linked-art-net)
> C# / DotNet library for Linked Art


## Platforms

* [LUX](https://github.com/project-lux/)
> Open source implementation of [LUX](https://lux.collections.yale.edu/), Yale's Linked Art based cross-collection discovery platform
* [Arches](https://www.archesproject.org/)
> A cultural heritage linked data management platform, suitable for implementing Linked Art
* [Ogee](https://github.com/thegetty/Ogee)
> Ogee Arches is a package designed for the Arches platform that implements the Linked Art data model (as of December 2023), and provides a complete vocabulary to support that data model and is fully documented with reusable documentation.


## Documentation Management

* [Zellij](https://zellij.pythonanywhere.com/docs/list/apppWYuo1z7E2J7E8?flag=0)
> Zellij is a semantic data pattern library which offers a reusable library of semantic data patterns which can be used as paradigms for your semantic data modelling project. The Linked Art semantic data model library on Zellij represents the Linked Art patterns in a compositional and user friendly format. The purpose of this representation is to aid potential users of the standard to learn it and apply it, including enabling the generation of derivative data management products like queries, mapping templates and display templates for semantic data management platforms.


## Validators

* [JSON Validator](validator/)
> An online validation service using the JSON schemas
