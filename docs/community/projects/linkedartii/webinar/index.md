title: "Webinar: Linked Art in Practice using Jupyter Code Notebooks - 
Connecting Cultural Heritage Collections Data"
---



# Webinar
The AHRC-funded Linked Art II project and Digital Scholarship at Oxford held a webinar on Tuesday 3 May 2022. 

## Code Notebooks
In this webinar, Research Software Engineer Tanya Gray guided attendees through a practical exploration of transforming, reconciling, and visualising Linked Art, using real-world data from museums and galleries worldwide. These were be demonstrated using ‘code notebooks’ developed during the Linked Art II project and implemented in Jupyter. The notebooks provide step-by-step illustration and explanation, and can provide a foundation for further customisation.

## Linked Art Questionnaire
The webinar complements a [questionnaire about Linked Art](../questionnaire).
