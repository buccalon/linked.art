# Exploring the Labyrinth with Quire

## An Exemplar Quire Project Based on the Labyrinth: Knossos Myth & Reality Exhibition

This page gives an exemplar of Quire use for museums by Dr. Andrew Shapland, who has reused materials created for his 2023 exhibition at the Ashmolean within new Quire-generated learning resources for the permanent Aegean World gallery.

### About the Exhibition

The [*Labyrinth: Knossos, Myth & Reality*](https://www.ashmolean.org/exhibition/labyrinth-knossos-myth-reality) exhibition was held at the Ashmolean Museum from **10 February to 30 July 2023**. This major exhibition explored the legend and archaeology of Knossos, the center of the ancient Minoan civilization on the island of Crete, and its association with the mythical labyrinth said to contain the Minotaur.

### Digital Resource Creation with Quire

Dr Andrew Shapland, curator of *Labyrinth: Knossos, Myth & Reality* created a digital publication for the exhibition using [Quire](https://quire.getty.edu/), an open-source publication software developed by the [Getty](https://www.getty.edu/), which allows users to build interactive, web-based resources. This publication is made available in the Resources section below as a PDF and a static website.

The digital publication created through Quire enables visitors, researchers, and educators to engage with the collection in new ways, offering a rich context for artifacts on permanent display as well as for loaned items.
