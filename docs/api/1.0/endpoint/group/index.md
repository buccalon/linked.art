## Introduction

The Group API is a method of getting access to descriptions of sets of people and/or subgroups, such as families, organizations, companies, departments or any other identifiable set of actors.  The Group model is of average complexity with many familiar properties and patterns, plus a few more specific fields.  This results in an average complexity API, which is very similar to the [Person API](../person/), that can result in reasonably long JSON responses if all of the fields have values. 

For more information about the usage of Group data, please see the [Group model](/model/actor/) description.


## Property Definitions

Dereferencing an entity via the Group endpoint would result in a JSON-LD document containing a single JSON object with the following properties.

### Incoming Properties

Group instances are typically found as the object of the following properties, other than the self-referential properties above.  This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to cover the likely cases where other endpoints refer to groups.

| Property Name              | Source Endpoint | Description |

| `current_owner`            | [Object](../physical_object/) | An object owned by the Group |
| `current_custodian`        | [Object](../physical_object/) | An object in the custody of the Group |
| `current_permanent_custodian` | [Object](../physical_object/) | An object that is normally in the custody of the Group |
| `represents`               | [Visual Work](../visual_work/)     | Image content which represents the Group (the inverse of `representation`) |
| `about`                    | [Textual Work](../textual_work/)    | Textual content that is about the Group |
