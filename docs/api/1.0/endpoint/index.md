## Introduction

The Linked Art API is made up of different endpoints, each of which has a defined structure for the format of the data that will be returned from it. These align (mostly) with the core classes of the model, and are structured according to the [API design principles](../principles/). 

## Endpoints

* [Abstract Works](abstract_work/) - Abstract works, such as the idea for an exhibition
* [Concepts](concept/) - Types, Materials, Languages, and others, as full records rather than external references
* [Digital Objects](digital_object/) - Images, services and other digital objects
* [Events](event/) - Events and other non-specific activities that are related but not part of other entities
* [Groups](group/) - Groups and Organizations
* [People](person/) - People
* [Physical Objects](physical_object/) - Physical things, including artworks, buildings or other architecture, books, parts of objects, and more
* [Places](place/) - Geographic places
* [Provenance Activities](provenance_activity/) - The various events that take place during the history of a physical thing
* [Sets](set/) - Sets, including Collections and sets of objects used for exhibitions
* [Textual Works](textual_work/) - Texts worthy of description as distinct entities, such as the content carried by a book or journal article
* [Visual Works](visual_work/) - Image content worthy of description as distinct entities, such as the image shown by a painting or drawing
